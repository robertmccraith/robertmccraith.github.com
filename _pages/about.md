I am a Research Scientist working on Computer Vision and Machine Learning Models.
I currently work with AiFi, a company that develops and deploys edge AI solutions for retail and other industries, focusing on camera pose estimation, 3D from images, and Object/Person detection. I am also a Research Associate at the Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford, where I work on Generative AI models.

Previously I was a DPhil (PhD) student supervised by [Prof. Andrea Vedaldi](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vedaldi/) and [Dr. Lukas Neumann](https://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/~neumalu1/) at the Visual Geometry Group, University of Oxford. During this time I worked on self-supervised methods for autonomous driving, including monocular depth estimation and 3D object.
