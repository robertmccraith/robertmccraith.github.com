# Work experience
## January 2022â€“Present: Computer Vision Research Scientist, AiFi
Developed computer vision solutions for autonomous shopping problems including:
* Camera Pose Estimation: developed camera pose estimation to enable rapid deployment of new facilities, built 3D environment reconstructions, and automatic camera selection to highlight human activity and product visibility.
* 2D/3D Object and Person Detection: from concept to production deployment. Including dataset construction and management, training pipelines, experiment management, efficient implementations and inference optimisation, deployment in a Kubernetes environment.
* 3D from images: developed systems to improve autonomous understanding of indoor environments to enable improved activity recognition, significantly reduce deployment time, while increasing accuracy, and enhanced client technical demonstrations.
* Led a team working on 3D geometry, mentored junior members, collaborated deeply with other teams, formulated research problems, designed and conducted experiments, gave company wide presentations of the latest research products.

## July 2023-Present: Research Associate, Oxford Internet Institute
Research on Generative AI for mathematical reasoning, evaluating reasoning in accuracy sensitive domains:
* Large Language and Vision Language Models: evaluating performance of existing models in specific domains, training and fine tuning to improve performance even with minimal data, defining research directions
* Technical guidance: efficient computational resource utilisation, model optimisation, distributed training, mentoring students with diverse backgrounds on model architectures, and programming techniques

## August 2013-September 2017: Data Scientist, Open WiFi Ltd.
Developed and maintained data pipelines, data analysis, and generated insights for business customers:
* Built pipelines to collect, clean, and store data from multiple sources
* Developed and maintained data analysis tools and dashboards
* Generated insights for business, and presented findings to non-technical audiences
* Gernerated reports for business on customer behaviour, WiFi usage, useful insights for customer retention
